companies can group the customers; based on their activity on the E-commerce site. This grouping can be done by applying different criteria like
previous orders, mostly searched brands and so on.

## Classification model details
Given the e-commerce data, use k-means clustering algorithm to cluster customers with similar interest.

## Solution

The solution includes the following steps:

Exploring missing value,skewness and outliers in the dataset.

Transforming the data into a suitable format and performing any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.

Developing a machine learning classification model which group  the customer using the K-means clustering.

Creating a Streamlit page where you can insert each column value and get the result of customer group.

## Requirements

This project requires the following libraries to be installed:

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Streamlit

## Getting Started


Install the required libraries.

Run the Streamlit app using the command: streamlit run app.py.

Enter the values for each column to get the result of customer group.
